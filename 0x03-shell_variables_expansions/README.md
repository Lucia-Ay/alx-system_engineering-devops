`perl -lne 'print if $. % 2==1'`
- This command prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line, using the Perl programming language.

`printf "%o\n" $(( $((5#$(echo $WATER | tr water 01234))) + $((5#$(echo $STIR | tr stir. 01234))) )) | tr 01234567 bestchol`
- This command converts the values in the `WATER` and `STIR` variables from their respective custom bases to decimal, adds them, converts the result to base "bestchol", and displays it.
